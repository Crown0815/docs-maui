This tutorial series is designed to continue the [Create a .NET MAUI app](../../notes-app/index.yml) tutorial, which created a note taking app. In this part of the series you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Upgrade your app to .NET 7 if it's currently .NET 6
> - Implement the model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) pattern
> - Use an additional style of query string for passing data during navigation

If you don't have access to the app's source code created in the [Create a .NET MAUI app](../../notes-app/index.yml) tutorial, you can download it [here_TODO]().
